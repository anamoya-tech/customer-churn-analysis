## Tableau Dashboard Development

The final stage of the project focused on transforming the analytical results into a clear and business-oriented dashboard using **Tableau Public**.

The dashboard was designed with an executive-level perspective, prioritizing clarity, interpretability, and storytelling over excessive complexity. Each visualization answers a specific business question related to customer churn.

### Dashboard Structure and Rationale

- **Overall Churn Rate**  
  A single KPI displaying the percentage of customers who have churned. This metric provides immediate context on the scale of the retention problem and serves as the entry point for the analysis.

- **Churn Rate by Contract Type**  
  A bar chart comparing churn rates across different contract types. This visualization highlights contract duration as one of the strongest churn drivers, with month-to-month contracts exhibiting significantly higher churn compared to long-term agreements.

- **Average Monthly Charges by Churn Status**  
  A comparison of average monthly charges between churned and retained customers. This view demonstrates that customers who churn tend to pay higher monthly fees, linking churn behavior directly to revenue considerations.

- **Monthly Revenue at Risk**  
  A KPI representing the estimated monthly revenue associated with customers who have churned. This metric emphasizes the financial impact of churn and supports prioritization of retention strategies for high-value customers.

### Design Choices

- A minimal and consistent color palette was used to reduce visual noise.
- The dashboard layout follows a top-down narrative: problem size, key driver, customer profile, and business impact.
- Interactivity was kept intentionally simple to ensure insights are understandable within seconds by non-technical stakeholders.

The dashboard serves as a practical example of how analytical results can be effectively communicated to decision-makers, bridging the gap between data analysis and business action.
